# Hypergraph Vault

We are building the Hypergraph Vault as a service to persistently host content. For a small fee, users can publish their modules to the Vault. Given that [~85% of researchers use Google Scholar to discover relevant work](https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-03-2018-0047), we are aiming to get all Vault content [indexed to Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#overview).
